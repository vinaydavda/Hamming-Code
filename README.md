# Hamming_Code
I have made a project in Python with Batch Scripts. 
Actually it is not git. Just a python Software.
It can be Implemented on any real life project too.
A real module of Hamming Code ever made. It is helpful for Understand work of it.
I made 3 versions of it :
1) Version 1 is just python files
2) Version 2 is with batch scripts
3) Version 3 is with batch scripts and auto-mnaual mode.
I have wrote readme.txt file for each version.
